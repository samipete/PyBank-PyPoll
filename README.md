    3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

    4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

    5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Part two: In the folder PyPoll, the main.py file contains python code to analyze:
    1. The total number of votes cast

    2. A complete list of candidates who received votes

    3. The percentage of votes each candidate won

    4. The total number of votes each candidate won
    
    5. The winner of the election based on popular vote
